# CourseStructure
Attempt from some years back to make a flowchart app for university courses. May have another go at this at some point because realistically this can be implemented with a graph structrue, which I wasn't really thinking about back then!

I think is a decent idea for a project to be fair, good graph implementation exercise, when I was doing this previously I got bogged down in using tkinter.
