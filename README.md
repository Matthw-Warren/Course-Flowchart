# Course Flowchart



Project from some years back to make a flowchart app for university courses.

May have another go at this at some point because realistically this can be implemented with a graph structrue, and seems to be a decently nice problem!

Reading this - its pretty horrid, so I may start anew!





I think is a decent idea for a project to be fair, good graph implementation exercise, when I was doing this previously I got bogged down in using tkinter.

Upon loading this in, there seems to be a problem with tkinter - will have a look.
