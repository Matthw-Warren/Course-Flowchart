# CourseStructure
Small project from some years back to make a flowchart app for university courses.

Having a look at this at the moment, trying to revive it slightly.

(I think is a decent idea for a project to be fair, good graph implementation exercise, when I was doing this previously I got bogged down in using tkinter.)
